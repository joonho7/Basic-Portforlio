		<div class = 'bio'>
			<p>I have ventured numerous different field and now I have finally arrived at the scene of coding.  Very excited and exuberant to tackle the new obstacles and challenges that are on my way and start a new section of life.  
			</p>
			<p>I believe my adult life began at Rutgers University and college life revolved around ROTC and becoming an officer in the United States Army. I eventually ended up in New Jersey National Guard and I have been serving as a officer in New Jersey Guard for almost six years now. </p>
			<p>Due to the nature of National Guard being part time service, I began looking for jobs after college and got involved in numerous fields.  I have been involved in freight importing and exporting, worked under a security and acoustic consultant for new and renovating buildings, and last job I held was paralegal for immigration firm.  I believe every job I held helped be to discover more about myself and made me into more versitile and mature individual.  Now I look forward to see myself growing in the field of coding in ways no other jobs have before. </p>
